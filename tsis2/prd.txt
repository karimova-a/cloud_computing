# PRD: PacketParser Component

## Overview
We need a Python class `PacketParser` that handles the ingestion of CSV files containing network equipment requests. This component is part of the larger Procurement Copilot system.

## Functional Requirements
1.  **Input**: The class must accept a file path (string) to a CSV file.
2.  **Output**: The `parse()` method must return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the CSV.
3.  **Error Handling**:
    -   The method must explicitly catch `FileNotFoundError` and raise a custom `PacketParserError` with the message "Input file not found".
    -   It must not crash the application if the file is missing.
4.  **Validation**:
    -   The CSV must contain a 'Quantity' column.
    -   The 'Quantity' must be validated to be a positive integer. If invalid (e.g., negative or text), that row should be skipped and logged (print to stderr is fine for now).

## Example CSV Format
```csv
Item,Quantity,Description
Router,5,High-cap router
Switch,2,Core switch
```
