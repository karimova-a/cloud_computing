Concept: Financial Reasoning & AI Governance.
Action:
Now that you have the PRD, you must justify building it.
Financial Reasoning: Estimate the ROI. If the AI Agent saves the Procurement Officer 10 hours a week, what is the financial impact based on average KZ salaries?
Governance Check: Apply the "Kazakhstan AI Ethics" test. Does feeding bank contracts into this AI violate data residency laws? Is the decision-making transparent?
Output: A "Go/No-Go" Executive Summary. This is your writing (human synthesis), validating if the project is legally and financially sound.
