SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT Development of Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) in Rural Areas\nThe subsidiary Auyl Telecom LLP is implementing pilot\nprojects to develop fixed wireless access (FWA) in rural\nareas, providing high-speed internet in locations where\nthe construction of fibre-optic communication lines\n(FOCL) or GPON networks is economically unfeasible.\nThis initiative helps reduce the digital divide and\ndeliver modern connectivity to residents of remote\nregions.\nAs part of the pilot projects, solutions based on Open\nRAN and 5G FWA have already been tested. In the\nvillage of Sarybay, the average connection speed\nincreased 85-fold \U2014 from 5 Mbps to 427 Mbps \U2014\nsignificantly improving the quality of online education,\ntelemedicine, and remote work. Thus, FWA not\nonly modernises outdated technologies (WiFi, ADSL,\nCDMA EVDO) but also becomes a key tool in bridging\nthe digital gap between urban and rural areas.\nAuyl Telecom continues to actively expand its\nFWA network, with 5G being a strategic focus\nfor the company. However, a 4G network is also\nbeing developed in parallel. A successful example\nof implementation is the village of Karatala in the\nAktobe region, where 79 out of 120 households\nhave been connected. The average connection\nspeed is 46 Mbps, and the average internet traffic\nconsumption per household over a three-week\nperiod reached 191 GB. For 10 subscribers, the data\nusage exceeded 450 GB during the same period. Testing of various network functions and technical solutions\n\U097b The technical feasibility and readiness of the\n\U097b\nhardware and software complex based on Open RAN\n5G Fronthaul for providing Internet access via fixed\nwireless access were tested. The operability of the\nOpen RAN 5G Fronthaul solution was confirmed with\nsome limitations.\n\U097b The invGUARD AS-SW software suite was\n\U097b\ntested to evaluate its capabilities in monitoring\nand analyzing network traffic statistics on the\nKazakhtelecom JSC network within the TelcoCloud\nenvironment.\n\U097b The VOLTHA GPON technology was tested in the\n\U097b\nTelcoCloud environment in the city of Konaev.\nThe main idea of this solution is disaggregation and\navoidance of vendor lock-in. In traditional GPON,\nOLT (stationary equipment), software, licenses, and\nONT (customer premises equipment) are supplied\nby a single vendor and are \U201clocked,\U201d which prevents\nconnecting ONTs from other manufacturers\nto an OLT of a different vendor or using software\nfrom other providers. The VOLTHA solution\novercomes these restrictions by allowing the\nselection of white-box OLT hardware from\none manufacturer, software and licenses from\nanother, and using the openOMCI standard\nto connect ONTs from different vendors.\n\U097b The product is not yet fully ready, but the\n\U097b\nconcept and implementation activity are already\ndelivering results. The pilot broadband project\nbased on VOLTHA is currently being implemented\nin Konaev.\n\U097b The service of providing access to cache servers\n\U097b\nfor telecom operators in Kazakhstan and Central\nAsia was tested.\n\U097b Testing has begun on an indoor solution\n\U097b\nto provide mobile Internet access using PicoCell\nin locations with poor mobile/broadband signal\nquality (e.g., shops, cafes located in basements).\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\n131\nInFORMAtion Security and Data\npROtection\nThe Company recognises the importance of ensuring\ninformation security and protecting its clients\U2019 data.\nKazakhtelecom JSC continues to develop a robust\ninformation security and data protection management\nsystem.\nManagement Approach\nGRI 3-3, 418-1\nThe Information Security Service reports directly\nto the Managing Director for Information Security, who\noversees information security issues at the highest level\nwithin the Company.\nThe key internal documents regulating information\nsecurity include:\n\U097b Information Security Policy;\n\U097b\n\U097b Personal Data Protection Policy\n\U097b\nof Kazakhtelecom JSC;\n\U097b Information Security Concept.\n\U097b\nThese documents are available on the Company\U2019s website\nin the \U201cSustainable Development\U201d section, under the\n\U201cInformation Security and Data Protection\U201d subsection.\nKey principles of information security management:\n\U097b compliance with legal requirements;\n\U097b\n\U097b involvement of top management in the information\n\U097b\nsecurity process;\n\U097b business orientation;\n\U097b\n\U097b process-based approach;\n\U097b\n\U097b comprehensive use of methods, tools, and means\n\U097b\nof protection;\n\U097b adherence to best practices;\n\U097b\n\U097b reasonable sufficiency;\n\U097b\n\U097b awareness and personal accountability.\n\U097b\nTo ensure information security, Kazakhtelecom JSC\napplies a systematic approach.

The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income.\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the\naggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at the acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any\nnon-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-\ncontrolling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree\U2019s identifiable net assets.\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.\n12\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\n3.

The acquired process is\nconsidered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an\norganised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly\ncontributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without\nsignificant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification\nand designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the\nacquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.\nContingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within\nequity.\nContingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9. Other contingent consideration that is not within the\nscope of IFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or\nloss.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount\nrecognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the\nGroup re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and\nreviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still\nresults in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is\nrecognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of\nimpairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the\nGroup\U2019s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or\nliabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is\ndisposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation\nwhen determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the\nrelative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.\nCurrent versus non-current classification\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the Group\U2019s consolidated statement of financial position based on\ncurrent/non-current classification. An asset is current when it is:\nExpected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;\nHeld primarily for the purpose of trading;\nExpected to be realised within 12 (twelve) months after the reporting period, or\nCash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 (twelve)\nmonths after the reporting period.\n13\n179\nKazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nCurrent versus non-current classification of assets and liabilities (continued)\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\nA liability is current when:\nIt is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;\nIt is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\nIt is due to be settled within 12 (twelve) months after the reporting period; or\nThere is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 (twelve) months after the\nreporting period.\nThe terms of the liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue and transfer of\nequity instruments do not affect its classification.\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.\nFair value measurement\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.\nFair-value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are measured at fair value or where\nfair values are disclosed, are summarised in Note 45.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the\ntransaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\nIn the principal market for the asset or liability; or\nIn the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when\npricing the asset or the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant\U2019s ability to generate economic\nbenefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the\nasset in its highest and best use.\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are\navailable to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of\nunobservable inputs.\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are\ncategorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement as a whole:\nLevel 1 \U2013 quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nlowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement\nis directly or indirectly observable;\nLevel 3 \U2014 valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement\nis unobservable.\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group\ndetermines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the\nlowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n14\n6. APPENDICES Kazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nFair value measurement (continued)\nThe respective unit of the Group (hereinafter, the \U201cWorking Group\U201d) determines the policies and procedures for both\nrecurring fair value measurement, such as investment properties and unquoted AFS financial assets, and for non-\nrecurring measurement, such as assets held for distribution in discontinued operations. The composition of the Working\nGroup is determined by the Management of the group.\nExternal valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as investment properties and unquoted financial\nassets, and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined\nannually by the Working Group after discussion with and approval by the Group\U2019s Audit Committee. Selection criteria\ninclude market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The Valuation\nCommittee decides, after discussions with the Group\U2019s external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use\nfor each case.\nAt each reporting date the Working Group analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are\nrequired to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Group\U2019s accounting policies For this analysis, the Working Group\nverifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to\ncontracts and other relevant documents.\nThe Working Group also compares the change in the fair value of each asset and liability with relevant external sources\nto determine whether the change is reasonable.\nThe Working Group and its external appraisers provide the valuation results to the Audit Committee and independent\nauditors of the Group on a regular basis that assumes discussion of main assumptions used in valuation.\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the\nnature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained above.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.\nSuch cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction\nprojects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property and equipment are required to be replaced\nat intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major\ninspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of property and equipment as a replacement if the\nrecognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The\npresent value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the\nrespective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. Please refer to asset retirement obligation (Note 27)\nfor further information about decommissioning provision recognised.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nYears\nBuildings Constructions Telecommunication equipment Other 50\n10\U201320\n3\U201320\n3\U201320\nLand is not depreciated.\nAn item of property and equipment and any significant component initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or\nwhen no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the\nasset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in\nthe consolidated statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.\nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property and equipment are year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\nreviewed at each financial\n15\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nProperty and equipment (continued)\nConstruction\U2013in-progress\nConstruction-in-progress represents property and equipment under construction and machinery and equipment awaiting\ninstallation and is recorded at cost. Construction-in-progress includes cost of construction and equipment and other\ndirect costs. When construction of such assets is completed or when the machinery and equipment are ready for their\nintended use, construction-in-progress is transferred to the appropriate category of depreciable assets. Construction-in-\nprogress is not depreciated.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired\nin a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are\ncarried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles,\nexcluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in\nthe period in which the expenditure is incurred.\nIntangible assets have finite useful lives.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment\nwhenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation\nmethod for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes\nin the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are\nconsidered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting\nestimates. Expenses on amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives are recognised in the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income in the category of expenses, which corresponds to the function of the intangible\nasset.\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal\nproceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive\nincome when the asset is derecognised.\nIntangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis within the following estimated useful lives.\nYears\nLicences Computer software Customer base Other 3\U201320\n1\U201314\n8\U201310\n2\U201315\nResearch and development costs\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an\nintangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:\nThe technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale;\nIts intention to complete the project and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset;\nHow the asset will generate future economic benefits;\nThe availability of resources to complete the asset;\nThe ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.\nFollowing initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any\naccumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is\ncomplete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised over the period of expected future benefits. Amortisation is\nrecorded in cost of sales. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.\n16\n180\nKazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any\nindication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\U2019s recoverable\namount. An asset\U2019s or cash generating unit\U2019s (CGU\U2019s) recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\U2019s or CGU\U2019s fair\nvalue less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the\nasset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where\nthe current amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written\ndown to its recoverable amount.\nIn assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In\ndetermining the fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such\ntransactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation\nmultiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.\nThe Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately\nfor each of the Group\U2019s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are\ngenerally covering a period of 5 (five) years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash\nflows after the fifth year.\nImpairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in\nthose expense categories that are consistent with the function of the impaired asset.\nFor assets, excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that\npreviously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the\nGroup estimates the asset\U2019s or CGU\U2019s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if\nthere has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset\U2019s recoverable amount since the last impairment\nloss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable\namount, nor does it exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no\nimpairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of\ncomprehensive income.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nmay be impaired.\nImpairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which\nthe goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is\nrecognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\nFinancial assets\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through\nother comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset\U2019s contractual cash flow\ncharacteristics and the Group\U2019s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not\ncontain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group\ninitially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or\nloss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group\nhas applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15.\n17\n6. APPENDICES Kazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nFinancial assets (continued)\nInitial recognition and measurement (continued)\nFor a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to\ncash flows that are \U2018solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)\U2019 on the principal amount outstanding. This\nassessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that\nare not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.\nThe Group\U2019s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to\ngenerate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash\nflows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost are held within a\nbusiness model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while financial\nassets classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with the objective of both\nholding to collect contractual cash flows and selling.\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or\nconvention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i. e., the date that the Group\ncommits to purchase or sell the asset.\nThe Group\U2019s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, financial assets at fair value through\nOCI, financial assets at amortised cost and other current financial assets.\nSubsequent measurement\nFor the purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\nFinancial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments);\nFinancial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);\nFinancial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon\nderecognition (equity instruments);\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinancial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)\nThis category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures its financial assets at amortised cost if both of the\nfollowing conditions are met:\nThe financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect\ncontractual cash flows; and\nThe contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject\nto impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.\nThe Group\U2019s financial assets at amortised cost include trade receivables, loans to employees, bank deposits and other\nnon-current and current financial assets.\nDerecognition\nA financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is\nderecognized (i.e. exluded from the Group's consolidated statement of financial position):\nThe rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\nThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the\nreceived cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \U2018pass-through\U2019 arrangement; and either\n(a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither\ntransferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the\nasset.\n18\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nFinancial assets (continued)\nDerecognition (continued)\nWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through\narrangement, the Group evaluates if it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership, and to which extent, if any.\nWhen the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred\ncontrol of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement..\nIn that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are\nmeasured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\nContinuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the\noriginal carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to\nrepay.\nImpairment of financial assets\nFinancial assets carried at amortised cost\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value\nthrough profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the\ncontract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original\neffective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the credit enhancements that are integral to\nthe contractual terms.\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk\nsince initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the\nnext 12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit\nrisk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the\nexposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track\nchanges in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group\nhas established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking\nfactors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However,\nin certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information\nindicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any\ncredit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of\nrecovering the contractual cash flows.\nFinancial liabilities\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans\nand borrowings, and payables.\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of\ndirectly attributable transaction costs.\nThe Group\U2019s financial liabilities comprise trade payables, loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, and debt component\nof preferred shares.\n19\n181\nKazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nFinancial liabilities (continued)\nSubsequent measurement\nThe subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\nLoans and borrowings\nThis category is the most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when\nthe liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an\nintegral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income.\nThis category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Further details are contained in Note 22.\nFinancial guarantee obligations\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse\nthe holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the\nterms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for\ntransaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at\nthe higher of the amount of the expected credit losses determined in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and\nthe amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nDebt component of preferred shares recorded in liabilities\nThe debt component of the preferred shares that exhibits characteristics of a liability is recognised as a liability in the\nconsolidated statement of financial position, net of transaction costs. The corresponding minimal guaranteed dividends\non those shares are charged as finance costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On initial\nrecognition, the fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting expected future cash flows at a\nmarket interest rate for a comparable debt instrument. The fair value of the equity component on initial recognition is\nassigned the residual amount after deducting the fair value determined for the liability component from the initial\ncarrying amount of the instrument as a whole. Subsequently, the liability component is measured according to the same\nprinciples used for loans and borrowings, and the equity component is not remeasured in subsequent years.\nTrade payables\nLiabilities for trade payables are recognised at fair value to be paid in the future for goods and services received,\nwhether or not billed to the Group.\nDerecognition\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When\nan existing financial liability is replaced by another one from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the\nterms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition\nof the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is\nrecognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nOffsetting of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and reported at the net amount in the consolidated statement of\nfinancial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and the Group intends to\neither settle on a net basis, to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n20\n6. APPENDICES Kazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nLeases\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the\nright to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nGroup as a lessee\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases\nof low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing\nthe right to use the underlying assets.\nRight-of-use assets\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date on which the underlying\nasset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment\nlosses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\nThe cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease\npayments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nThe Group determined the following useful lives:\nYears\nBuildings and constructions Site for networks and equipment of base stations Equipment 5\U201310\n5\U201310\n3\U201315\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a\npurchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\nThe right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section Impairment of non-\nfinancial assets.\nLease liabilities\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease\npayments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed\npayments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts\nexpected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase\noption reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease\nterm reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate.\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to\nproduce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease\ncommencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement\ndate, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments\nmade. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease\nterm, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used\nto determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\nShort-term leases\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of property and equipment that\nhave a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and the lessor has an unconditional right to\nterminate the contract. Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\n21\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nLeases (continued)\nGroup as a lessor\nLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset\nare classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added\nto the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.\nContingent rents are recognised as revenue and other income in the period in which they are earned.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost of acquisition and net realisable value.\nCost comprises expenses incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is\nthe estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs\nnecessary to make the sale. The same cost formula is used for all inventories having a similar nature and use. All\ninventories are determined based on the weighted average cost method.\nCash and short-term deposits\nCash and short-term deposits in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and\nshort-term highly liquid deposits with a maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to a known amount\nof cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\nProvisions\nGeneral\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a\nreliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be\nreimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only\nwhen the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement.\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects,\nwhen appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the\npassage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\nDecommissioning liability\nDecommissioning liabilities are recognised in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for\nenvironmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual\nmaterials and remediation of disturbed areas) in the reporting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.\nDecommissioning costs are recorded at the discounted value of expected liability settlement costs calculated using\nestimated cash flows and recognised as part of the initial cost of the particular asset. The cash flows are discounted at a\ncurrent pre-tax rate that reflects the risks inherent in the decommissioning liability. Unwinding of discount is expensed\nas incurred and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as finance costs. The estimated\nfuture costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. Changes in the estimated future\ncosts, or in the discount rate applied, are added to or deducted from the cost of the asset.\nEmployee benefits\nSocial tax\nThe Group pays social tax according to the current statutory requirements of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Social tax\nexpenses are charged to expenses as incurred.\nBesides, the Group withholds 10% of the salary of employees paid as contributions of employees to the accumulating\npension funds. Under the legislation, employees are responsible for their retirement benefits and the Group has no\npresent or future obligation to further compensate its employees upon their retirement, except as provided below.\n22\n182\nKazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nEmployee benefits (continued)\nPension payments\nThe Group does not incur any expenses in relation to provision of pensions or other post-employment benefits to its\nemployees. In accordance with the legal requirements of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Group withholds pension\ncontributions from employee salaries and transfers them into state or private pension funds on behalf of its employees.\nPension contributions are the responsibility of employees, and the Group has no current or future obligations to make\npayments to employees following their retirement. Upon retirement of employees, all pension payments are\nadministered by the pension funds directly.\nDefined benefit pension plan\nThe Collective Agreement between the Company and its employees provides for certain long-term and retirement\nbenefits to some of its employees (the \U201cDefined Benefit Scheme\U201d).\nLong-term benefits are paid to employees upon completion of a certain number of years of service whereas retirement\nbenefits represent one-off payments made upon retirement in accordance with the Collective Agreement. Both items\nvary according to the employee\U2019s average salary and length of service.\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in\nnet interest on the net defined benefit obligation and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net\ninterest on the net defined benefit obligation), are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of financial\nposition with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur.\nRemeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.\nPast service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of:\nThe date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and\nThe date that the Group recognises related restructuring costs.\nNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit obligation or asset. The Group\nrecognises the outlined changes of net defined benefit obligation in the lines: \U201ccost of sales\U201d and \U201cgeneral and\nadministrative expenses\U201d in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nCash dividend and non-cash distribution to equity holders of the Parent\nThe Group recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders of the Parent when the\ndistribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. According to the legislation,\ndistribution is approved by the shareholders.\nA corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. Non-cash distributions are measured at the fair value of the\nassets to be distributed with fair value remeasurement recognised directly in equity.\nUpon distribution of non-cash assets, any difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the carrying\namount of the assets distributed is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nTreasury shares\nOwn equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain\nor loss is recognised in profit or loss on the acquisition, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group\U2019s own equity\ninstruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in equity.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to the\ncustomer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those\ngoods or services.\n23\n6. APPENDICES Kazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenue from contracts with customers (continued)\nThe Group\U2019s activities mainly relate to the provision of data transmission services, rendering of fixed line and wireless\nphone services, rent of channels, local, intercity and international calls, interconnect / traffic transmission of other\noperators, value added services and sale of equipment and mobile devices.\nAt the beginning of the contract, the Group assesses the goods and services promised in the contract with the customer\nand defines each promise to transfer a certain product or service or a set of certain goods or services to the customer as a\nperformance obligation.\nThe Group has concluded that it is a principal in all of its revenue arrangements since in all cases it is the main party\nthat assumed obligations under the contract, controls the goods and services before transferring them to the customer.\nProvision of services\nThe Group\U2019s revenues are principally derived from the provision of wireless and fixed line local, domestic long distance\nand international long distance telecommunication services.\nInterconnection fees from domestic and foreign telecommunications operators are recognised when the services are\nrendered based on the actual minutes of traffic transferred through the network.\nRevenues from international and intercity calls and calls to local operators are recognised at the time the call is made\nover the Group\U2019s network.\nSubscription fees, consisting primarily of monthly charges for access to broadband and other internet services or voice\nservices, are recognised as revenue over time on a straight-line basis. Revenue from dial up internet is recognised based\non the actual airtime provided to the customers.\nRevenue from the rental of analogue and digital channels and private circuits as well as wholesale access revenue is\nrecognised over the period because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the\nGroup when it fulfils its contractual obligations.\nNon-refundable upfront fees received for initial connection of new subscribes to fixed line and wireless networks are\nrecognised during the expected period of the customer relationship. The expected period of the customer relationship is\nbased on the history of customer period and industry practice.\nEquipment provided to customers\nThe Group provides Internet and other data transmission services and equipment for the provision of these services,\nincluding modems, routers, etc.\nBased on the analysis of current operating indicators, the Group concluded that equipment that cannot be used by the\nsubscriber separately from the Group\U2019s services is not a separately identifiable performance obligation.\nThe Group capitalises the cost of equipment provided free of charge as costs to fulfil a contract are amortised over the period the service is provided to the customer.\ncontract. Costs to fulfil a\nSale of equipment and mobile devices\nThe Group may bundle services and products into one customer offering. Offerings may involve the delivery or\nprovision of multiple products, services, or rights to use assets (multiple deliverables). In some cases, the arrangements\ninclude initial installation, initiation, or activation services and involve consideration in the form of a fixed fee or a\nfixed fee coupled with a continuing payment stream. Costs associated with the equipment are recognised when revenue\nis recognised. The revenue is allocated to separate product and services on a relative stand-alone selling price method.\nThe stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells the mobile devices and\ntelecommunication services. Customised equipment that can be used only in connection with services or products\nprovided by the Group is not accounted for separately and revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the total\nservice arrangement period.\n24\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenue from contracts with customers (continued)\nSale of equipment and mobile devices (continued)\nIn revenue arrangements with more than one performance obligation, transaction price is allocated between the goods\nand services using the relative stand-alone selling price method. Determining the transaction price for each separate\nperformance obligation can require complex estimates. The Group generally determines the stand-alone selling price for\neach separate performance obligation based on prices at which the goods or services are regularly sold on a stand-alone\nbasis after considering volume discounts where appropriate.\nRoaming discounts\nThe Group enters into roaming discount agreements with a number of wireless operators. According to the terms of the\nagreements the Group is obliged to provide, and entitled to receive, a discount that is generally dependent on the\nvolume of inter operator roaming traffic. The Group uses various estimates and assumptions, based on historical data\nand adjusted for known changes, to determine the amount of the discount to be received or granted. Such estimates are\nadjusted monthly to reflect newly-available information.\nThe Group accounts for discounts received as a reduction of roaming expenses and discounts granted as reduction of\nroaming revenue. The Group considers terms of the various roaming discount agreements to determine the appropriate\npresentation of the related receivables from and payables to its roaming partners in its consolidated statement of\nfinancial position.\nSignificant financing component\nGenerally, the Group receives short-term advances from customers. Using the practical expedient in IFRS 15, the Group\ndoes not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract\ninception, it expects that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and the date\nwhen the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\nThe Group also receives long-term advances from customers for the connection to international telecommunication\nnetwork. The Group discounts the transaction price for such contracts, using the rate that would be reflected in a\nseparate financing transaction between the Group and its customers at contract inception, to take into consideration the\nsignificant financing component.\nCost to obtain a contract\nThe Group sells part of payment scratch cards, sim cards, and handsets using sales agents. The Group pays commission\nto sales agents for new connected subscribers in the B2C segment. The commission to sales agents is capitalised as\ncosts to obtain a contract in the consolidated statements of financial position. Costs to obtain a contract are amortised\nover the period the service is provided to the customer.\nGovernment grants and compensation for provision of universal services in rural areas\nGovernment grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached\nconditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic\nbasis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates\nto an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.\nWhen the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and\nreleased to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits of\nthe underlying asset by equal annual instalments.\nGovernment grants and compensation for provision of universal services in rural areas are presented separately in the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income within revenues from operating activities.\n25\n183\nKazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued D)\nRevenue from contracts with customers (continued)\nCustomer loyalty programmes\nTransactions performed for the purposes of promotional activities through the use of mobile phone balances and OGO\nbank cards as well as for other activities of the Group\U2019s subscribers which lead to accrual of bonus points to the\ncustomers as part of the Group\U2019s OGO Bonus loyalty programmes, are accounted for as two separate performance\nobligations, included in a single contract \U2013 commission. The transaction price is allocated between the commission price\nand the granted bonus points based on separate selling prices. The transaction price in the form of bonus points is not\nrecognised as revenue at the time of the initial sale. It is deferred and recognised as revenue once the bonus points have\nbeen used by the subscriber, and the Group has fulfilled its performance obligations.\nContract balances\nContract assets\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group\nperforms by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays the consideration or before the\npayment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.\nTrade receivables\nA receivable is recognised if an amount of consideration that is unconditional is due from the customer (i.e., only the\npassage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies for financial assets\nin section .\nContract liabilities\nA contract liability is recognised if a payment is received or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from a customer\nbefore the Group transfers the related goods or services. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group\nperforms under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods or services to the customer).\nInterest income\nFor all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest-bearing financial assets classified as AFS, interest\nincome is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future\ncash receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying\namount of the financial asset. The interest income is recorded as part of finance income in the consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income.\nExpense recognition\nExpenses are recognised as incurred and reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period\nto which they relate on the accrual basis.\nConnection cost\nThe Group records connection costs incurred and attributable to the related deferred income over the expected period of\nthe customer relationship.\nBorrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a\nsubstantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other\nborrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that\nthe Group incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n26\n6. APPENDICES Kazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nIncome tax\nCurrent income tax\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the\ntaxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively\nenacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable profit.\nCurrent income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect\nto situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where\nappropriate.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\nWhen the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a\ntransaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting\nprofit nor taxable profit or loss;\nIn respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests\nin joint arrangements, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is\nprobable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and\nany unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be\navailable against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax\nlosses can be utilised, except:\nWhen the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of\nan asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects\nneither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;\nIn respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and\ninterests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the\ntemporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the\ntemporary differences can be utilised.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no\nlonger probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilised.\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has\nbecome probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the reporting year when the\nasset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively\nenacted as at the reporting date.\nDeferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items\nare recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.\nTax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that\ndate, are recognised subsequently to reflect new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is\neither treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the\nmeasurement period or recognised in profit or loss.\nThe Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off\ncurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes\nlevied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to\nsettle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in\neach future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or\nrecovered.\n27\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\n3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nContingent assets and liabilities\nContingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements. Where an inflow of economic benefits is\nprobable, they are disclosed.\nContingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements unless an outflow of resources\nembodying economic benefits has become probable. They are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources\nembodying economic benefits is remote.\nRelated parties\nIn accordance with IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to\ncontrol the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions.\nTransactions with related parties are used to reflect the status of settlements for property, work and services received\nfrom companies or sold to companies that are related parties to the Group. Items of a similar nature are disclosed in\naggregate except when separate disclosure is necessary for an understanding of the effects of related party transactions\non the consolidated financial statements.\n4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires the management to make judgements,\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the\naccompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.\nUncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the\ncarrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\nOther disclosures relating to the Group\U2019s exposure to risks and uncertainties includes:\nFinancial instruments and financial risk management objectives and principles \U2013 Note 45;\nSensitivity analyses disclosures \U2013 Notes 11 and 24.\nJudgements\nIn the process of applying the Group\U2019s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which\nhave the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:\nDetermining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options \U2013 the Group as a lessee\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an\noption to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the\nlease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\nThe Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in\nevaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is,\nit considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.\nAfter the commencement date, the Group re-assesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in\ncircumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to\nterminate.\nThe Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of machinery and equipment with a shorter\nnon-cancellable period. The Group typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be\na significant negative effect on production if a replacement asset is not readily available.\n28\n184\nKazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n4. CRITICAL Judgements (continued)\nACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS (continued)\nThe Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease; therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing\nrate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a\nsimilar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use\nasset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group \U2018would have to pay\U2019, which\nrequires estimation when no observable rates are available (such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing\ntransactions) or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (for example, when leases\nare not in the subsidiary\U2019s functional currency). The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market\ninterest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates (such as the subsidiary\U2019s stand-\nalone credit rating).\nUseful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets\nThe Group assesses the remaining useful lives of items of property and equipment and intangible assets at least at each\nfinancial year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an\naccounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.\nOn initial recognition, the Group assessed the useful life of 5G frequencies to be 15 years based on an assessment of the\ndevelopment of communication technologies, the practices of other mobile operators and the expected average period of\nincome generation from the use of 5G frequencies. As at 31 December 2024, the Group concluded that the useful life of\n5G frequencies remained unchanged.\nEstimates and assumptions\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that\nhave a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next\nfinancial year are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available at the time\nwhen the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future\ndevelopments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the Group\U2019s\ncontrol. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nImpairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which\nis the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is\nbased on available data from binding sales transactions in an arm\U2019s length transaction of similar assets or observable\nmarket prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted\ncash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next 5 (five) years and do not include restructuring\nactivities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset\U2019s\nperformance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used\nfor the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and growth rates used for extrapolation\npurposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity\nanalysis, are disclosed and further explained in Note 11.\nAllowance for expected credit losses\nThe Group recognises a provision for expected credit losses for receivables and funds in credit institutions (cash and\ncash equivalents, and bank deposits).For trade and other receivables, the Group has applied the simplified approach\npermitted by the standard and has calculated expected credit losses based on the lifetime of these financial instruments.\nThe Group used a provision model that is prepared based on the Group\U2019s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for\nthe factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the\nhistorical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.\nFor instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e., gross domestic product) are expected to deteriorate over the next year\nwhich can lead to an increased number of defaults in the telecommunications sector, the historical default rates are\nadjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking\nestimates are analysed.\n29\n6. APPENDICES Kazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS (continued)\nEstimates and assumptions (continued)\nAllowance for expected credit losses (continued)\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a\nsignificant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and in forecast economic conditions.\nAlso, the Group\U2019s historical credit loss experience and forecast economic conditions may not be representative of the\ncustomer\U2019s actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on the Group\U2019s trade receivables is disclosed in\nNote 15.\nFor funds in credit institutions (cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits), the Group calculated expected credit losses\nbased on the 12-month period. The 12-month expected credit losses is the portion of lifetime expected credit losses that\nresults from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.\nHowever, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the provision will be based on the\nlifetime expected credit losses.\nThe Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than\n30 days past due. Also, it is considered that a financial asset is in default when contractual payments are 90 days past\ndue. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external\ninformation indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into\naccount any credit enhancements held by the Group.\nThus, as at 31 December 2024, the provision for expected credit losses was created in the amount of\nKZT 19,549,197 thousand (2023: KZT 17,628,662 thousand) (Notes 12, 15, 17 and 20). Changes in the economy,\nindustry or specific customer conditions would have an impact on these allowances recorded in the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nSignificant financing component\nThe Group concludes that certain long-term contracts contain significant financing components due to the time interval\nbetween the provision of the Group\U2019s services to the customer and the moment the customer pays for such services.\nThe transaction price for such contracts is discounted, using the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing\ntransaction between the Group and its customers at contract inception.\nCost to obtain a contract\nThe Group considers commission to sales agents to be an additional cost to obtain a contract, and capitalises such costs\nto obtain contracts with customers as an asset. The Group depreciates the costs to obtain a contract with customers on a\nsystematic basis, which corresponds to the timing of the provision of services to customers. The Group reviews\ndepreciation periods if the expected service dates have changed.\nContract liabilities\nDeferred revenues are recognised as contract liabilities and recorded over the expected period of the customer\nrelationship. In making its judgements, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenues\nfrom contracts with customers set out in IFRS 15, industry practice and the Group\U2019s historical churn rate.\nNon-refundable upfront fees\nUpfront fees received for activation and connection to the fixed line and the wireless network that do not represent a\nseparate earning process are recognised as contract liabilities and recorded over the expected period of the customer\nrelationship. In making its judgements, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenues\nfrom connection fees set out in IAS 15, industry practice and the Company\U2019s historical churn rate. As at\n31 December 2024, average customer relationship period is assessed as 13 (thirteen) years for fixed line customers and\n5 (five) years for internet customers.\n30\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\n4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS (continued)\nEstimates and assumptions (continued)\nDecommissioning liability\nDecommissioning liabilities are recognised in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for\nenvironmental rehabilitation costs in the reporting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.\nDecommissioning costs are recorded at the discounted value of expected liability settlement costs calculated using\nestimated cash flows and recognised as part of the initial cost of the particular asset. The cash flows are discounted at a\ncurrent pre-tax rate, which reflects the risks inherent in the decommissioning liability. The unwinding of the discount is\nexpensed as incurred and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as finance costs. The\nestimated future costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. Changes in the estimated\nfuture costs, or in the discount rate applied, are added to or deducted from the cost of the asset.\nEmployee benefit obligations\nThe Group uses the actuarial valuation method for measurement of the present value of defined employee benefit\nobligation and related current service cost. This involves the use of demographic assumptions about the future\ncharacteristics of current and former employees who are eligible for benefits (mortality, both during and after\nemployment, rates of employee turnover, etc.) as well as financial assumptions (discount rate, future salary increases).\nDue to the long term nature of these benefits, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.\nThe current portion of employee benefit obligations represents the obligations which the Group is going to repay within\nthe twelve months period since the end of the annual reporting period.\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group\U2019s management considers the interest rates of high-yield\ncorporate bonds in respective currencies.\nThe mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Future salary increases and pension increases are\nbased on expected future inflation rates.\nFurther details about the assumptions used are contained in Note 24.\nTaxes\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be\navailable against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the\namount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised in the consolidated financial statements, based upon the likely\ntiming and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the carrying amount of recognised tax assets was KZT 163,330 thousand (31 December 2023:\nKZT 369,451 thousand). Further details are contained in Note 40.\nLeases \U2013 estimating the incremental borrowing rate\nThe Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease; therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing\nrate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a\nsimilar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use\nasset in a similar economic environment. Therefore, the IBR reflects what the Group \U2018would have to pay\U2019, which\nrequires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and\nconditions of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when\navailable and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates.\nFair value measurement of financial instruments\nWhen the fair value of financial instruments and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of financial\nposition cannot be measured based on data in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques,\nincluding the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where\npossible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. The judgements\ninclude considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Any changes in assumptions about these\nfactors could affect the fair value reported in the consolidated financial instruments.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING\nGoodwill\nFor impairment testing, goodwill acquired through business combinations was allocated to three cash-generating units\n(\U201cCGUs\U201d) (\U201cIP TV\U201d, \U201cKcell JSC\U201d and \U201cMobile Telecom-Service LLP\U201d).\nIP TV CGU is part of the fixed telecommunications segment, while Kcell JSC and Mobile Telecom-Service LLP are a\npart of the mobile telecommunication segment.\nGoodwill relates to the assembled workforce and synergy from integration of the acquired subsidiaries into the Group.\nThe carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of CGUs was as follows:\nIn thousands of tenge 2024 2023\nKcell JSC IP TV Mobile Telecom-Service LLP* (Note 41) 96,205,967\n53,489,943 53,489,943\n2,706,335 2,706,335\n56,196,278 152,402,245\n* As at 31 December 2024, goodwill attributable to Mobile Telecom-Service LLP was reclassified to assets held for sale (Note 41).\nThe Group performed its annual impairment test in December 2024 and 2023.\nImpairment test\nPursuant to IAS 36, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet\nbrought into use must be tested for impairment annually or more often if indicators of impairment exist. Other assets are\ntested for impairment when circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment.\nFor the purpose of the impairment testing, the Group assessed the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to\nwhich goodwill was allocated or where indicators of impairment were identified.\nThe Group determined that the fact that, as at 31 December 2024, the Group\U2019s net assets were higher than the market\ncapitalisation as an indicator of impairment and performed an impairment test. In 2023, in line with the previous years,\nthe impairment test was performed as at 31 December. Since there were impairment indicators, the impairment test for\nthe Group was performed for each separate cash generating unit (CGU). Accordingly, the Group tested its CGU\n\U201cKazakhtelecom JSC\U201d. The impairment test identified that the recoverable amount of non-current assets was higher than\nthe carrying amount of the Group\U2019s assets.\nIn 2024, the recoverable amounts of all cash generating units were determined based on the value-in-use calculation.\nThis valuation technique uses cash flow projections based on the actual operating results and business plans approved\nby management and appropriate discount rates reflecting the time value of money and risks associated with respective\ncash-generating units. For the periods not covered by the management\U2019s business plans, terminal value is used. The\nterminal value is calculated based on the cash flow projections by extrapolating the results of the respective business\nplans using a zero real growth rate.\n40\n188\nKazakhtelecom JSC Consolidated financial statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n11.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nMobile Telecom-Service LLP\nOn 30 April 2024, the Group\U2019s general meeting of shareholders decided to sell 100% interest in Mobile Telecom-\nService LLP (MTS), a subsidiary, to Power International Holding (PIH), a third party. On 30 April 2024, MTS was\nclassified as a disposal group held for sale and as discontinued operations since MTS represents the Group\U2019s separate\nsignificant line of business providing GSM and LTE mobile telecommunication services.\nOn 4 June 2024, the Group entered into an agreement on the sale of MTS with PIH Interconnect Ltd. (PIH\U2019s\nsubsidiary).\nOn 12 November 2024, amendments were made to the main agreement, according to which the rights and obligations\nunder the agreement were assigned to another subsidiary of PIH - PIH Communication LLC. According to the signed\nagreement, the parties agreed on preliminary conditions that must be met to complete this transaction for the transfer of\nownership and control from Kazakhtelecom JSC to PIH Communication LLC. As of 31 December 2024, the transfer of\nownership of 100% of the stake in MTS was not completed due to the ongoing process to fulfill the conditions for the\ncompletion of the transaction, and, accordingly, the Group retained control over MTS. The sale of 100% interest in\nMTS was completed in January 2025 (Note 47). The selling price of the 100% share in MTC was USD 1,100,000,000,\nwhich includes a component of contingent consideration.\n67\n6.

This\nvaluation technique uses cash flow projections based on the actual operating results and business plans approved by\nmanagement and appropriate discount rates reflecting the time value of money and risks associated with respective\ncash-generating units. For the periods not covered by the management\U2019s business plans, terminal value is used.

The main\nrisks associated with the Group\U2019s financial instruments include interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. In\naddition, the Group monitors market risk and liquidity risk associated with all financial instruments.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had no loans or borrowings with floating interest rates and was not exposed to the\nrisk of changes in market interest rates. In 2024, the Group issued bonds with a floating interest rate on Astana\nInternational Exchange JSC. The Group\U2019s exposure to the interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group\U2019s bonds with\nthe floating interest rate, which is equal to the average value of base rates of the National Bank of the Republic of\nKazakhstan during the coupon period plus the fixed margin of 0.5%\U20131%.\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on that portion of loans\nand borrowings.

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables)\nand from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions\nand other financial instruments.\nTrade and other receivables\nFinancial instruments in which the Group\U2019s credit risk is concentrated are primarily trade and other receivables. The\ncredit risk associated with these assets is limited due to the large number of the Group\U2019s customers and the continuous\nmonitoring procedures for customers and other debtors.\nAn impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses.\nThe provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss\npatterns (i.e., by geographical region, product type, customer type and rating, and coverage by letters of credit or other\nforms of credit insurance). The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and\nreasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and\nforecasts of future\neconomic conditions. Generally, trade and other receivables are written-off if past due for more than one year and are\nnot subject to enforcement activity. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount of\neach class of financial assets disclosed in Notes 12, 15 and 17.\nFinancial instruments and cash deposits\nIn accordance with the financial policy, the Group places free cash in several of the largest Kazakhstani banks (with the\nhighest credit ratings). To manage the credit risk associated with the placement of free cash in banks, the Group\U2019s\nmanagement periodically conducts procedures for assessing the solvency of banks. To facilitate such an assessment,\ndeposits are primarily placed in banks, where the Group already has comparable credit obligations, a current account\nand can easily monitor the activities of such banks.\n74\nIntegrated Annual Report / 2024\nKazakhtelecom JSC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated financial statements\nCash balance Balance on deposit accounts\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n45.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nOperating environment\nIn Kazakhstan, economic reforms and the development of the legal, tax and administrative infrastructure that meets the\ndeveloped markets reforms, as well as policy.\nare still in process. The future stability of the Kazakhstan economy will largely depend on these\non the effectiveness of the Government\U2019s actions in the area of economy, financial and monetary\nCapital commitments\nThe Group generally enters into contracts for the completion of construction projects and purchase of\ntelecommunication equipment. As at 31 December 2024, the Group had contractual obligations in the total amount of\nKZT 77,112,435 thousand (VAT included) (31 December 2023: KZT 97,469,118 thousand (VAT included)) mainly\nrelated to the purchase of telecommunication equipment and the construction of the telecommunication network.\nLicense commitments\nUnder the terms of certain licences on the provision of wireless telecom services, the Group has certain obligations in\nterms of the coverage area of its network. The Group is obliged to expand the cellular telecommunication coverage to\nthe regions along the major highways and small-sized towns and urban-type communities of the Republic of\nKazakhstan. The Group\U2019s management believes that the Group is in compliance with the terms of the licences.\nIn December 2022, the Group participated in a radio frequency spectrum public auction for 5G mobile communications.\nThe Group won two lots: 3600\U20133700 MHz and 3700\U2013 3800 MHz. On 22 June 2023, the Group met all conditions of the\nauction and recognised an intangible asset for 5G radio frequencies use for KZT 78,034 million, with the estimated\nuseful life of 15 years. According to the conditions attached to the award of frequencies to the Group, it undertakes to\nactivate 3,527 5G base stations throughout the country, with a specified number of base stations in each region. For\n2024 and 2023, the Group fulfilled its licence obligations and activated 784 and 391 base stations, respectively. The\nGroup committed to activate 784 5G base stations yearly until the end of 2027. During 2024, Mobile Telecom-Service\nLLP and Kcell JSC, the Group\U2019s subsidiaries, signed a network sharing agreement for 5G to meet the licence\nobligations for 5G networks.\nTaxation\nTax legislation and regulatory framework of the Republic of Kazakhstan are subject to constant changes and allow for\ndifferent interpretations. In addition, management believes that international agreements, under which the Group works\nwith non-residents residing in International Telecommunication Union, and which provide for certain tax exemptions,\nhave a priority over national tax legislation. Instances of inconsistent opinions between local, regional and national tax\nauthorities are not unusual. The current regime of penalties and interest related to reported and discovered violations of\nKazakhstan\U2019s tax laws is severe. Penalties are generally 80% of the taxes additionally assessed and interest is assessed\nat the refinancing rate established by the National Bank of Kazakhstan multiplied by 1.25. As a result, penalties and\ninterest can amount to multiples of any assessed taxes. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect\nof taxes for five calendar years preceding the year of review.\nDue to the uncertainty surrounding the tax system in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the ceiling amount of taxes, penalties\nand interest, if any, may exceed the amount expensed at the date and accrued as at 31 December 2024. Management\nbelieves that as at 31 December 2024 its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Group\U2019s tax\npositions will be sustained, except as provided for or otherwise disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.\nState grant related to the frequency fee\nThe Group presented a summary report on expenditures aimed at financing broadband Internet access projects in urban\nand rural areas, including capital and operating costs required to provide broadband Internet access services in urban\nand rural settlements throughout the Republic of Kazakhstan.
